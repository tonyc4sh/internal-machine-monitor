## Security Considerations

ForgeGrid is a **demonstration/simulation** application. It does not:
- Process real production data
- Connect to actual manufacturing systems
- Store sensitive information

However, if you deploy this in a production environment, ensure:
- Proper authentication is implemented
- API endpoints are secured
- Environment variables are not exposed
